### Path 1: Interview Prep (1-2 days)
Focus on fundamentals and commonly asked questions:
1. Lessons 01-05 (Fundamentals)
2. Lessons 06, 09, 11 (useEffect, Performance, Keys)
3. Review `99-interview-checklist.md`

### Path 2: Production-Ready (1-2 weeks)
Build strong practical skills:
1. All Fundamentals (01-05)
2. All Intermediate (06-15)
3. Lessons 16, 17, 19 (State management, Testing, TypeScript)

### Path 3: Deep Mastery (1 month)
Complete understanding of React:

## 💡 Tips for Using These Lessons

- **Code along**: Don't just read—type out examples
- **Break things**: Change code and observe what happens
- **Ask "why"**: Understand the reasoning behind patterns
- **Practice explaining**: Teach concepts back in your own words
- **Check yourself**: Use the self-check questions at the end of each lesson
